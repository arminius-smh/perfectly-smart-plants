Dashboards

# General & Sidebar

We have a sidebar were we can display Dashboards or links to Add-On's and co.
At the top we have *Overview*. And while it might look tempting, don't use it, every single new Device will appear there and it will be a nightmare.

Instead, we will create our very own Dashboard. For that we go to **Settings** > **Dashboards** > **+ ADD DASHBOARD** (bottom right corner) and follow the instructions.
I really like using Icons as it makes the Sidebar more easy and compfortable to navigate.

# Dashboard

To edit a Dashboard, click on the Menu Symbol (â‹®)on the upper right corner and then on *edit dashboard*.
You now have the option to add Views and rename them. I suggest starting with one and letting it develope.

Usecases for multiple Views are:
- Different rooms
- Per Person Views so everyone can have displayed what they want
- Different categories, like
    - Music
    - Plants
    - Temperature

# View

We now finally reached the view, the Place we can add "Cards", the boxes with content's like graphs, buttons, Images and more.

On the bottom right we have a Button called "+ADD CARD". Clicking it gives us a landslide of possibilities we will explore in a second.

Some of these Cards showcase simple inforamtion, some can controll Devices, and some can simply contain other cards. There are more, but those are the most important ones right now.

If we will be more advanced later, we can also just code our own to fit our niche needs.

# Cards

Having clicked on "add card" we are faced with 2 options. we can choose a card and then add the device we wan't, or we choose the device we want and get recommended a card. While the choose a device option is a good beginning, it often is not what we where looking for, especially in more complex scenarios than turning on and off a light.
