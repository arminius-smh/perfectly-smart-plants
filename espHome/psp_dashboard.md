Perfectly Smart Plants Dashboard
===

I chose to create a new Dashboard for the Project, to contain all the info. In it i used the Pregenerated View "Home", no need to change that I thought.

# Cards

I started out choosing every Card I thought looked like it might fit and after some testing came up with these as a good starting Point:

- Button: Simply to test the LED on the esp and if we are annoyed while testing
- Statistic: Showing the current Moisture is especially important for users to quickly see the most important info, no need for historic data just to see if i need to water or drain at the moment
- Statistics graph: This one is good to have a historic view, to properly judge a plants needs, to create a better watering schedule, or to plan for hollidays.
- Sensor: More fun to look at than the statistics graph, but less information. I just liked it and the look of it.
